# Gotta Catch 'Em All

 An interactive Pokémon game website. The website is formatted to be like the video games. Professor Juniper tells the player the scenario to set the game. Because it is law where Pokémon are free from their trainers and get to live wildly, I have made catching Pokémon difficult but not impossible.

## Challenge
> I wanted to create something different as a website. It tackles feelings when people feel stressed to have a "forever career" and have life figured out by graduation or shortly after.

## Solution
> The themes of the game are about hope and perseverance. Everything you do is pointless, so do you pursue on or just give up? I consider this a metaphor of life. It's a throwback and fun game with deep thoughtful undertones.
